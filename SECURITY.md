- **Low**: $100 - $500 in WEAD tokens
  - Minor security issues
  - Best practice violations

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- Smart contracts deployed on BSC Mainnet
- Backend API (bot_simple.py)
- Web application frontend
- Blockchain integration code

**Out of Scope:**
- Third-party services
- DDoS attacks
- Social engineering
- Physical attacks

### Rules

1. Do not access or modify data belonging to others
2. Do not perform actions that could harm the availability of our services
3. Do not use automated scanners without permission
4. Provide detailed reports with reproducible steps
5. Give us reasonable time to fix the issue before public disclosure
6. Act in good faith and avoid violating privacy

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Never share your private keys**
- Use hardware wallets for large amounts
- Enable 2FA where available
- Keep your software up to date
- Be cautious of phishing attempts
- Verify contract addresses before interacting

### For Developers

- **Never commit sensitive data** (.env files, private keys)
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Validate all user inputs
- Use prepared statements for database queries
- Keep dependencies updated
- Implement rate limiting
- Use HTTPS for all communications

## Smart Contract Security

Our smart contracts follow these security practices:

- **OpenZeppelin Standards**: Using battle-tested libraries
- **Reentrancy Guards**: Protection against reentrancy attacks
- **Access Controls**: Proper permission management
- **Pausable**: Emergency stop functionality
- **Upgradability**: Safe upgrade patterns
- **Gas Optimization**: Efficient code to prevent DoS
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 95%+ test coverage
- **External Audits**: Regular security audits

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Detection**: Monitoring systems alert the team
2. **Assessment**: Team evaluates the severity and impact
3. **Containment**: Immediate actions to prevent further damage
4. **Eradication**: Remove the vulnerability
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review and improvements

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is confirmed. Users will be notified through:

- GitHub Security Advisories
- Twitter (@WeADPlatform)
- Telegram announcements
- Email to registered users

## Contact
