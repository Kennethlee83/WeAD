## ⚠️ SECURITY WARNINGS

### Never Commit These:

- ❌ `.env` file
- ❌ Private keys
- ❌ API keys
- ❌ Database passwords
- ❌ JWT secrets
- ❌ Wallet seed phrases

### Always Use:

- ✅ Environment variables
- ✅ `env.example` template
- ✅ `.gitignore` file
- ✅ Secure secret management

## 🔄 Updating Your Repository

When you need to update:

```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin main
```

## 📊 GitHub Best Practices

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "Add: New feature X"
git commit -m "Fix: Bug in campaign creation"
git commit -m "Update: README documentation"
git commit -m "Refactor: Smart contract gas optimization"
```

### Branch Strategy (for future development)

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/new-feature

# Create Pull Request on GitHub
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If you accidentally committed `.env`:

```bash
# Remove from git but keep local file
git rm --cached .env

# Commit the removal
git commit -m "Remove .env file"

# Push changes
git push origin main

# Then add .env to .gitignore if not already there
```

### If repository is too large:

```bash
# Check size
du -sh .git

# Remove large files from history (if needed)
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -rf path/to/large/files' HEAD
```

### If push is rejected:

```bash
# Pull latest changes first
git pull origin main --rebase

# Then push
git push origin main
```
